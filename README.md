# Show My PR's

## Motivation 😰

I wanted to create an `Open Source` section on [my website](https://karanjthakkar.com) to showcase some of the contributions that I have done over the years. Finding the PR's, sorting them, grouping them was a big pain. I couldnt't find any service that did this already. 


## Features 💅🏻💥

1. Show the actual status of each pull request: `open` / `closed` / `merged`
2. All your Pull Requests grouped by repositories: `/user/<username>`
3. Add `?response_type=json` to consume the json response directly


## Implementation notes 🙇🏻

1. Fetch all the pull requests from the github `search/issues` endpoint

  `https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=type:pr+author:gaearon+is:public`

2. For each pull request, fetch the repository data (stars/forks)

  `https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo`

  **Note**: *The repository data is cached in-memory and is reused between subsequent calls.*

3. The search endpoint returns status as `closed` even for pull requests that have been merged. So, for each closed pull request, the merge status is fetched using the below endpoint.

  `https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/merge`

4. These pull requests are then grouped based on the repository and then sent to the client.

**NOTE**: The final response is cached on the server per user in a file `./.cache/<username>`. For now, this will be ~~manually purged by me every 24 hours~~ automatically refreshed every 30 minutes using a cron job running via [this bash script](./refresh.sh). Eventually, it should go into some cache like Redis which has its own TTL implementation.


## Contributing 👯

- Make sure you have installed Go and setup your workspace
- Get the latest code: `go get github.com/karanjthakkar/showmyprs.com`
- Start the server: `go build && ./showmyprs.com` (This requires the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. [Heres how](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) you can get yours)

If you need help figuring out how to contribute (since its written in Go), hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geekykaran) or [Email](mailto:karanjthakkar@gmail.com). I would love to help you get set up ☺️


## Deploying 🚀

- Pre-requisite: `npm install`
- `grunt build deploy`: This builds the binary for my Ubuntu linux instance on Amazon EC2 and uploads it along with the web assets via `scp`.
